## How to use
**Installing:**
* Download the latest release (.zip) by clicking the download button above and choosing one of the Releases under the "Assets" dropdown
  * You may want to save it in the exact location you want the assets to be in
* Right click the zip file and click the "Extract all..." button
  * This only covers Windows 10 - 11, and older Windows versions or Linux/MacOS may require you to instead use [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) or [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or extract the file via the terminal which to do so;
    * In the terminal, use your prefered package manager to install the unzip package, an example being; ```sudo apt-get install unzip``` **(LINUX, ignore this step if you've already installed the unzip package!)**
    * Then run ```unzip [filename here].zip```, or optionally ```unzip [filename here].zip -d (destination folder)``` if you would like to extract the files to a specific folder **(LINUX)**<br>
    
**Importing into Mine-imator (2.0.0)**
* In a project, navigate to the top left corner of the screen and click the "File" text, then click the second to last option; "Import asset..."
  * You can also drag and drop assets from your file explorer, which may be quicker
* Navigate to the chosen model, select it (left click), and in the bottom right click "Open" <br> <br>
